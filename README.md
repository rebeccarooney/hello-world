# hello-world
I am making my first Git Repo

I am a wetland ecologist and Associate Professor in the Department of Biology at the University of Waterloo.  

I am learning to use Git to help with our research collaborations and version control.  

Two truths and a lie: I love chocolate pudding, I saw Bob Marley live, I don't know how to use R.

What else is there to know?
